**WebPhenote** enables the creation and refinement of *models* that associate facts and their supporting evidence with the model's *subject*. In the current WebPhenote Disease-Phenotype-Onset configuration, each *fact* or *association* consists of a Phenotype and an Age of Onset, and one or more evidence citations.

WebPhenote will eventually support other configurations that can capture other associations, including genetic and biological process details.
